### Tasks

- evaluate stackspin, sovereign-workplace and other alternatives according to predefined usability criteria
- create quiality criteria for my project, that cover the weaknesses ot the alternatives

### Notes

- found [stackspin](https://www.stackspin.net/) and [sovereign-workplace](https://software.opencode.de/project/351)
  - both alternative that are similar in, that they use a single node K8s cluster for hosting predefined applications
  - Usability for stackspin is lacking, in the way, that only technical knowledgeable people can easily deploy it.
- realigned the theme of the project to be more focuses on usability for layman's
- helmfiles with gotmpl are the way to implement plugins (inspired by sovereign-workplace)

- maybe a fork of an alternative is the way to go, since it already has a lot of the functionality that i need and can be easily extended with my usability focus.
